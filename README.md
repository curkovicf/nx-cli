### üë®‚Äçüíª Who is it for

While working at my current job with Nx monorepos I have noticed that I spend a lot of time in CLI manually typing various commands to generate stuff and to manouver around the nx monorepo. The core idea of this app is to minimize the time spent in the CLI, and automate the process of creating, deletion etc. of libs, projects and their artifacts.

<br>

### üè¢ Architecture & Patterns 

- SCAM -> Single component angular modules for better tree shaking
- UI components -> Everthing that is under UI folder should recieve the data only via @Input(), and emit it via @Output(). These components can only inject services regarding the view, E.g. MaterialDialog service 
- Feature components -> Can be routed to, can access data from any source 
- Shell -> Entry point for some domain. Shell should always have feature in which we store routes, and layout which should be the layout for the current domain. Layout can access any data and should be in layout folder under shell lib.
- ViewModel -> Ngrx Store is used as a global store while ngrx/@component-store is used as a [viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel). Viewmodel should grab the data from the global store (or some other source) and prepare it for the view injection via async pipe, also, majority of the business logic is located in the viewmodels which helps to keep our components clean and extremely easy to test and maintain.

> üö® Some of the patterns are not 100% enforced because I am still exploring and trying stuff out
